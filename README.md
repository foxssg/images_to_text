# images_to_text
A python script to convert multiples image files to text and merge them to a single PDF file

This is the list of libraries that you have to have installed on your computer:

os

pytesseract

PyPDF2

reportlab

glob


You can install all the libraries from pip. Open the terminal and type "pip install reportlab" / "pip3 install reportlab"

You have to choose a path where your files are for example "/home/user/Downloads/", then you have to write a file extension to work with, for example "jpg" "png", without "." (dot). The last thing that yo need to do is to write the name for your file for example "image001" and a "image001.pdf" file will be created in the directory that you have chosen early.
